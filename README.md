# Tensor-flow-and-Pytorch
This project compares MNIST digit classification using TensorFlow and PyTorch with different model architectures, optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, SGD), and training loops. Models are exported to TFLite and ONNX formats. Includes training time, accuracy, and custom training logic for benchmarking.
